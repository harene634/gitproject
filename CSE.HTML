    <div <p>Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of electrical engineering and computer science that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop 
        computer hardware and software.[1] Computer engineers not only require training in electronic engineering, software design, and hardware-software integration, but also in software engineering. It uses the techniques and principles of
         electrical engineering and computer science, but also 
        covers areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, 
        from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves 
        work, yet it also demands them to integrate into the larger picture.[2] Robots are one of the 
        applications of computer engineering.<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/utep-uploads/wp-content/uploads/sparkle-box/2021/02/16122228/OU-MSEE-2020-Q2-Skyscraper-What-is-Computer-Engineering-Header.jpg" alt="S" width="300" height="300"></div>
